Base kinds of DATABASE and tiny description.

1. Key-Value Database - Redis, Memcached, etcd
#Like JSON, SET(to add value), GET(to retrieve), data held in machine memory not on hard disk. Thus, Superfast and mainly used for cache, PUB/SUB etc.

2. Wide Column Database - Cassandra, Hbase
# Handles unstructured data, uses CQL(Contextual Query Language), mainly for storing history etc.

3. Document Oriented Database - MongoDB, Firestore etc.
# JSON unstructured document

4. Relational Database - MySQL, PostgreSQL etc.
# Uses SQL and also ACID compliant
Cockroach Labs - More optimized for scalability

5. Graph - Neo4j, Dgraph
# Uses Cypher for querying, often used in building knowledge base, recommendation engine etc.

6. Search Engine - elastic, Solr(Most of them are on the top of Apache lucene project)
Cloud Based - Algolia, MeiliSearch
# These are Full Text database. An index like in the back of the book is created. On search, an index is searched on the object.

7. Multi-Model Database - FaunaDB
Uses GraphQL
# Just define how want to consume data, and it will automatically figure out how to take the best advantage of all paradigms.
The best.
